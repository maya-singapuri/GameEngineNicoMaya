Welcome to GameEngineNicoMaya! 


This project consists of 4 subdirectories:
  - our game engine
  - game 1
  - game 2
  - game 3
    
Game 1, game 2, and game 3 all have dependencies on the game engine crate. Game 1 relies on elements of the game engine's geom, grid, and level modules. Game 2 and Game 3's primary dependency is on the game engine's geom module.

A brief preview of our games (see our trailers for more information!):

Game 1: A time-pressured coin collection game. Collect as many coins as possible before your time runs out. Try to beat previous players' high scores!

Game 2: An adventure game that can prove a helpful pedagogical tool. Follow the yellow brick road to navigate around this game world and discover interesting visuals!

Game 3: Raindrops are falling on your head! But alas, you are aquaphobic. Dodge the raindrops before it is too late and you fall with them to the ground!

To run each game, enter its directory and hit "cargo run." Enjoy!
